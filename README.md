# 🔍 Overview

I created and organized a series of automations to demonstrate how low-code tools can support real-world use cases involving AI and workflow automation. 

The interface showcases prompt-based and event-driven workflows that reduce manual work, improve response times, and make advanced automation accessible to cross-functional teams. It’s designed to be clean, modular, and easily adaptable across both technical and enterprise-facing environments.

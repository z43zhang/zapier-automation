# ⚡ Zapier Automations, Chatbot & Interface

This project showcases a curated collection of Zapier automations and a public Zapier Interface, built to demonstrate how no-code workflows can streamline email communication, document creation, and business process automation.

## 🔍 Overview

I created and organized a series of Zaps into categories to highlight real-world use cases that non-technical teams can use to save time and reduce manual work. The interface is designed to be clean, user-friendly, and useful for showcasing automation concepts in both technical and marketing environments.
